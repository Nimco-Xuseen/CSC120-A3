Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
- Liyana and Sofia
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
  I wasn't able to attend neither of those but I did consult the teachers via chat. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Java is not that bad, but technically this is my first time ever doing coding so my experience might be different from other people's. I am taking it day by day.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
- Many languages support both object-oriented (OO) and procedural programming styles. Java, for instance, is explicitly object-oriented, whereas languages like Python can accommodate both OO and procedural approaches.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- I was having a hard time figuring out how to add the question mark at the first response and also having an uppercase when it responds. I have got it all figured out after sometime. Ask for help whenever you get stuck at something.
